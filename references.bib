The community college baccalaureate (CCB) model has raised questions about the evolving role of the comprehensive community college and mission differentiation. In the past decade, a growing number of community colleges have taken the necessary steps with state legislatures, governing boards, and regional accrediting associations to implement baccalaureate degree programs. This study develops a formal method to identify and examine comparable CCB peer institution data sets. The numerous factors leading community colleges to consider conferring bachelor degrees are also examined.},

This paper describes a methodology developed as an alternative to conventional institutional classification structures, intended to reduce (if not eliminate) the limitations of those models: arbitrariness, a priori specification of the classification structure, and the inability to accommodate more than a limited number of classification criteria. Using a combination of factor analysis and cluster analysis, eight homogeneous groups of institutions were developed from the population of all doctoral degree-granting institutions in the AAUP's "Category I." A discriminant function analysis indicates that the eight groups are each different from the others at statistically significant levels. Ways in which the methodology can be used for planning, administrative, and research purposes are discussed, as are the dangers in using "peer groups" for institutional planning and analysis.},

The peer groups were to serve the analytic needs of budgeting, performance measurement, and trend analysis. Because of several critical political issues requiring interinstitutional unity, the peer groups had to be developed and implemented with the participation and support of the seven university presidents. In addition, the peer groups had to be understood and accepted by board members, legislators, and the governor's office. Through a process that combined detailed statistical information with a sensitivity to the political dynamics and judgments of campus presidents and staff, the system office developed a set of peer groups that found acceptance in both the political and analytical environments. Ten conditions that contribute to the creation of peer groups on a systemwide basis are identified and offered as guidance to other university systems.},

In this paper, we argue that regardless of the approach taken it is likely that schools do not address this task as rigorously as they should. In this regard, we point out overlooked reasons for the importance of the PAC list, and we discuss various approaches that can enable schools to be much more intentional in creating their PAC list.},
